# SMARTSalah ML and Knowledge Graph Implementations

This repository have two more sub-branches:

Testing_FYP2 Branch:

This branch contain our SMARTSalah application which include following features:
1. Salah activity summaries on daily, weekly, and monthly basis
2. Time duration dedicated to each step of performed Salah
3. Visuals and graphs for displaying the average time spent on Salah
4. Stats of missed/qaza prayers
5. History of previously performed prayers along with their summaries

Master Branch:

1)ML_Model File:
It is a python file that contain all Models we trained and save model as pickel file.

2)App.py:
App.py is also a python file which is a deploy on heroku cloud that takes sensor readings do predictions and send results to android application.

3)app:
This folder contain Initial and Basic layout files of our SmartSalah app.

4)Salah Track Tizen app:
This app is used to get sensor readings(accelerometer) of person performing Salah. These sensor readings are sent to heroku cloud where android application is deploy

5)knowledge Base:
This file contain ontology which is knowledge based reasoner that tells completness and correctness of Salah.
